## About

[macgraz.at](https://www.macgraz.at) is an interactive website for an independent Apple Support Professional located Graz, Austria. Therefore the language is German. It's an attempt to recreate the Apple operating system with CSS and some Javascript. Significant features of macOS should allow the user to interact with the web page. For example, if all windows are closed, a warning message will appear prompting you to contact or restart the page. If Javascript is deactivated, another warning appears, which asks you to contact the person responsible.
